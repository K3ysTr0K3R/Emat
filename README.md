# Emat
Emat is an advanced scraping tool designed to collect email accounts from platforms like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, and government email services. However, it's crucial to emphasize that the script should only be used for educational purposes and not for any abusive or unethical activities.

To utilize the script effectively, you will need to crawl and download website content using the 'wget' command. Here's an example of how to use it: 'wget -r https://example.com'.

Once the site has been successfully crawled, Emat will proceed to download pages for you to scrape and search for email accounts. It employs an email regular expression to identify email addresses within the downloaded site directory. It's a straightforward process, and Emat makes it easy for you to retrieve the desired email accounts. Remember to use the tool responsibly and ethically.
