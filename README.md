# Emat

Emat is a scraping tool that will gather Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail and government email accounts.
Do not abuse this script it is only meant for educational purposes!

to use the script you will have to crawl and download contents of a website by using the 'wget' command

Example: 'wget -r https://example.com'

After it will crawl a site, it will then download pages for you to scrape for emails with Emat.
An email regular expression will then be executed on your current directory where you downloaded the site for Emat to look for email accounts, sounds easy right? :)
